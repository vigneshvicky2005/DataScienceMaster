    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax\n",
    " errors\n",
    " \n",
    "       In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When a Python script encounters an exception, it interrupts its normal flow of execution and raises an exception object, which contains information about the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Exceptions are different from syntax errors in Python. A syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter is unable to interpret the code due to a mistake in the syntax. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all. Common examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing or mismatched parentheses, and incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "       On the other hand, exceptions occur during the runtime of a program and are not related to syntax. Exceptions can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as dividing a number by zero, attempting to access an undefined variable, or trying to open a non-existent file. Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program, allowing it to recover from the error and continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In summary, the main differences between exceptions and syntax errors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Syntax errors occur during the parsing of code and prevent the program from running, while exceptions occur during the execution of the program and can be caught and handled.\n",
    "      * Syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the code's syntax, while exceptions are caused by errors in the program's logic or external factors.\n",
    "      * Syntax errors are generally easy to detect and fix, while exceptions can be more difficult to diagnose and correct."
