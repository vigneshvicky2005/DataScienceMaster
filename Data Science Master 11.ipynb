    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "        Multithreading in Python refers to a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously within a single process. A thread is a lightweight subprocess that shares the same memory space as the parent process and runs independently of other threads. Multithreading is used in Python to improve the performance of a program by utilizing multiple CPUs or CPU cores, and also to improve the responsiveness of the program by allowing it to handle multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The module used to handle threads in Python is called \"threading\". It provides a simple and efficient way to create, start, and manage threads in Python. The \"threading\" module allows developers to create multiple threads within a single program and also provides synchronization primitives like locks and semaphores to ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources."

    "     * Increased efficiency: Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently, which can improve the overall efficiency of the program.\n",

    "     * Better resource utilization: Multithreading can help to make better use of system resources, such as CPU time and memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "   Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Increased complexity: Multithreading can make the program more complex and harder to debug due to issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Synchronization overhead: When multiple threads access shared resources, they need to be synchronized to avoid conflicts, which can add overhead and reduce performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Increased memory usage: Each thread requires its own stack and other data structures, which can increase the memory usage of the program.\n",

    "     * Difficulty in writing correct code: Multithreading requires careful design and implementation to ensure that the code is correct and free of bugs.\n",

    "    * Deadlocks:\n",
    "        Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release the resources, resulting in a standstill situation where both threads are blocked and cannot proceed. It is a situation where a thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread, while the second thread is waiting for a resource that is held by the first thread. Both threads end up waiting indefinitely for each other to release the resource, resulting in a deadlock. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve, and can cause the entire program to freeze or crash.\n",
