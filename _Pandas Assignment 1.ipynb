    "    Pandas provides several built-in window functions, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Rolling Windows: These functions create a rolling window of fixed size and perform calculations on the data within that window. Some commonly used rolling window functions are:\n",

    "    * mean(): Calculates the mean of the values in the window.\n",

    "    * min(): Finds the minimum value in the window.\n",
    "    * max(): Finds the maximum value in the window.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Expanding Windows: These functions gradually expand the window size as more data points become available. They calculate aggregated statistics on the entire preceding data. Some commonly used expanding window functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * expanding(): Generates an expanding object that computes statistics on the expanding window.\n",
    "     * mean(): Calculates the mean of all preceding values.\n",
