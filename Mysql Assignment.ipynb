    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    A database is a collection of data that is organized in a structured manner so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are commonly used in software applications to store information such as customer data, financial transactions, or inventory records.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems. SQL databases are relational databases, meaning they store data in tables with rows and columns that have a defined relationship with one another. The data is organized in a structured manner and is accessed using SQL commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, NoSQL databases do not use tables with rows and columns, and instead store data in various formats such as document, key-value, graph, or column-family. NoSQL databases are often used for handling large volumes of unstructured data or for real-time applications where fast read and write operations are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Data structure: SQL databases use a structured format with tables, columns, and rows, while NoSQL databases can use various data structures such as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased traffic by adding more hardware resources. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle increased traffic by adding more servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Flexibility: SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning the data structure is defined in advance and cannot be easily changed. NoSQL databases have a flexible schema, meaning the data structure can be easily modified as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Querying: SQL databases use SQL commands to query data, which can be powerful but may require more effort to write complex queries. NoSQL databases often have simpler query languages that are optimized for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Overall, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases will depend on the specific needs of a project or application. SQL databases are often used for structured data with complex relationships, while NoSQL databases are often used for unstructured data that requires high scalability and flexibility."

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     In a relational database, a primary key and a foreign key are two types of constraints that are used to define relationships between tables. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "      1. Primary Key: A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that there are no duplicate rows in the table. Primary keys are typically used to link related tables together through a foreign key constraint. For example, in a customer and orders database, the customer ID column in the customer table could be used as the primary key, while the order table would have a foreign key column that links to the customer ID column in the customer table.\n",
    "\n",
    "      2. Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key in another table. It is used to define a relationship between two tables and enforce referential integrity. The foreign key column in a table contains values that match the primary key values in another table. For example, in a customer and orders database, the order table would have a foreign key column that links to the customer ID column in the customer table. This ensures that orders are associated with a valid customer and prevents orphaned records.\n",
    "\n",
    "       In summary, a primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while a foreign key is used to define a relationship between two tables and ensure referential integrity. Together, they allow related tables to be linked and data to be stored in a normalized way."
