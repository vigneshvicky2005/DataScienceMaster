    "A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown or when the sample size is small (typically n < 30).

    "Let's say a researcher wants to compare the mean heights of two groups of students: Group A and Group B. The researcher collects height data from both groups and wants to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the mean heights.

    "\n",
    "    One-tailed and two-tailed tests are terms used to describe the directionality of a statistical hypothesis test. The distinction lies in how the alternative hypothesis is formulated and how the critical region is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-tailed test:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In a one-tailed (or one-sided) test, the alternative hypothesis is directional, specifying an expected difference or relationship in a specific direction. The critical region for the test is concentrated on one side of the sampling distribution.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug and expects it to increase patients' cognitive performance. The null hypothesis (H0) would state that the drug has no effect or has a negative effect, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) would state that the drug improves cognitive performance. In this case, a one-tailed test would be appropriate because the interest is specifically in the drug's positive effect, and the critical region would be in the upper tail of the sampling distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-tailed test:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a two-tailed (or two-sided) test, the alternative hypothesis is non-directional, suggesting the possibility of a difference or relationship in either direction. The critical region for the test is split between both tails of the sampling distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where a researcher wants to test whether a new teaching method has an effect on test scores. The null hypothesis (H0) would state that there is no difference in test scores between the two methods, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) would state that there is a difference, without specifying the direction. In this case, a two-tailed test would be appropriate because the researcher is interested in determining if there is any difference, regardless of whether it is an increase or decrease, and the critical region would be divided between the upper and lower tails of the sampling distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a one-tailed test is used when there is a specific directionality in the alternative hypothesis, and the critical region is concentrated on one side of the sampling distribution. A two-tailed test is used when the alternative hypothesis is non-directional, and the critical region is split between both tails of the sampling distribution. The choice between the two depends on the specific research question and the direction of interest."

If the researcher incorrectly rejects the null hypothesis and concludes that the drug is effective when it actually has no effect, it would be a Type 1 error.

    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes's theorem, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, is a fundamental concept in probability theory that provides a way to update the probability of an event based on new evidence. It relates the conditional probability of an event A given event B to the conditional probability of event B given event A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Bayes's theorem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) represents the probability of event A given event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) represents the probability of event B given event A.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A) represents the probability of event A.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) represents the probability of event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate how Bayes's theorem works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say there is a rare disease that affects 1 in 10,000 people. A diagnostic test has been developed to detect this disease, but it is not perfect. The test has a 99% accuracy rate, meaning that it correctly identifies a person with the disease 99% of the time and correctly identifies a person without the disease 99% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider a person who has just taken the test and tested positive for the disease. We want to determine the probability that this person actually has the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the following notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Person has the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "B: Test result is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the information, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A) = 1/10,000 (probability of having the disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) = 0.99 (probability of a positive test given the person has the disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) = ? (probability of a positive test result)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find P(B), we need to consider the probabilities of true positives and false positives. Since the test has a 99% accuracy rate, it means it will produce a false positive result (indicating disease when the person doesn't have it) in 1% of cases where the person doesn't have the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\n",
    "\n",
    "= 0.99 * (1/10,000) + 0.01 * (9,999/10,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "≈ 0.010098\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can use Bayes's theorem to calculate the probability of the person actually having the disease given a positive test result:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "= (0.99 * (1/10,000)) / 0.010098\n",
    "\n",
    "≈ 0.009803\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even with a positive test result, the probability of this person actually having the disease is approximately 0.009803, or about 0.98%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how Bayes's theorem allows us to update our belief in light of new evidence. It highlights the importance of considering the accuracy of the test, as well as the base rate (prevalence) of the condition, in interpreting the results correctly."

    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is constructed using sample data and provides an estimated range of plausible values for an unknown population parameter. It is commonly used in statistical inference to quantify the uncertainty or variability associated with an estimate.\n",

    "To calculate a confidence interval, the following information is needed:\n",

    "Let's say a researcher wants to estimate the average height of a certain population. The researcher collects a random sample of 100 individuals from the population and measures their heights. The sample mean height is found to be 170 cm, with a sample standard deviation of 5 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher wants to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height. This means they want to be 95% confident that the interval they construct contains the true population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of the confidence interval involves the use of the sample mean, sample standard deviation, sample size, and the appropriate critical value from the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) or t-distribution, depending on the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sample size is relatively large (n ≥ 30), we can use the Z-distribution and the critical value associated with a 95% confidence level, which is approximately 1.96.\n",

    "The formula for calculating the confidence interval for the population mean is:\n",

    "Confidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n",

    "= 170 ± (1.96 * 0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "= 170 ± 0.98\n",
    "\n",
    "The 95% confidence interval for the population mean height is approximately (169.02, 170.98). This means that we can be 95% confident that the true population mean height falls within this interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the confidence interval, we can say that if we repeated the sampling process many times and constructed confidence intervals in the same way, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a confidence interval provides a range of values within which an unknown population parameter is estimated to lie. The calculation involves sample data, a chosen confidence level, and appropriate critical values from the relevant distribution. The interpretation of the confidence interval reflects the level of confidence in the estimate."

    "The sample size has a direct impact on the margin of error. As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases.
