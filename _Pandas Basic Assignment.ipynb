    "    Pandas provides a wide range of functions to manipulate data in a DataFrame. Here are some common functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. head() and tail(): Used to view the first or last few rows of a DataFrame, respectively. For example, you might use df.head() to quickly inspect the top records of a large DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. info(): Displays the summary information about the DataFrame, including the column names, data types, and non-null counts. It helps to understand the structure and integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "     3. describe(): Generates descriptive statistics of the DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values. It provides insights into the distribution and summary statistics of the numerical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "     4. loc[] and iloc[]: Used for indexing and selecting data from the DataFrame. loc[] is label-based, allowing you to access rows and columns by their labels. iloc[] is integer-based, enabling access by integer positions. For example, you can use df.loc[2:4, 'Age'] to select rows 2 to 4 and the 'Age' column.\n",
    "\n",
    "     5. drop(): Removes specified rows or columns from the DataFrame. It is useful for data cleaning and filtering. For instance, you might use df.drop(['column1', 'column2'], axis=1) to remove 'column1' and 'column2' from the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "     6. fillna(): Fills missing values in the DataFrame with a specified value or strategy. It helps handle missing data effectively. For example, you can use df.fillna(0) to replace NaN values with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "     7. groupby(): Groups the DataFrame based on specified columns and allows you to perform aggregations, such as sum, count, mean, etc., on the grouped data. It is useful for data summarization and analysis. For instance, you can use df.groupby('Category')['Revenue'].sum() to calculate the total revenue for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "      These are just a few examples of the many functions available in Pandas to manipulate data in a DataFrame. The specific functions you use depend on the requirements of your analysis or data processing tasks."
