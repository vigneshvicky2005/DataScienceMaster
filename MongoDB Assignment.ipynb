    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "     MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It stores data in flexible, semi-structured documents that can vary in structure from record to record, unlike SQL databases that require a fixed table schema. MongoDB uses a JSON-like format to store data, which makes it easy to work with for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional SQL language for querying and organizing data. They use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family models, to store and access data. NoSQL databases are generally more scalable and better suited for handling large and unstructured data sets than traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "     MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is semi-structured or unstructured, such as with web applications that store user-generated content or with data that is constantly changing. It is also preferred in scenarios that require high availability, scalability, and performance. For example, MongoDB is commonly used in big data and real-time analytics applications because of its ability to handle large amounts of data and support for distributed systems. Additionally, MongoDB can be easier and faster to set up and use for developers than traditional SQL databases, as it does not require a fixed schema and allows for more flexible data modeling."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "     MongoDB has a number of features that make it a popular choice for modern database applications. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "     1.Document-oriented data model: MongoDB stores data in a flexible, document-oriented data model, which allows for easy and dynamic schema evolution. Each document can have its own unique structure, and you can nest documents and arrays within one another for hierarchical representation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "     2.Indexing: MongoDB provides a rich set of indexing options to support fast querying and sorting of data. Indexes can be created on any field in a document, including arrays and sub-documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "     3.Aggregation: MongoDB provides powerful aggregation and data processing capabilities, allowing you to perform complex data analysis and transformation operations using a variety of built-in functions and operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "     4.Automatic sharding: MongoDB can automatically shard (partition) data across multiple servers in a cluster, providing high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "     5.Replication: MongoDB supports automatic replication of data across multiple nodes, providing high availability and fault tolerance in case of server failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "     6.GridFS: MongoDB includes a powerful GridFS file storage system that allows you to store and manage large files (such as images, videos, and audio) directly within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "     7.Flexible queries: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports ad-hoc queries, full-text search, and geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "     8.Support for multiple programming languages: MongoDB provides drivers and APIs for a wide variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, and Node.js, making it easy to integrate with your preferred development stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Overall, MongoDB's flexible data model, powerful indexing and aggregation features, automatic sharding and replication, and support for multiple programming languages make it a powerful and popular choice for modern database applications."
