    "        In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that has its own unique characteristics and behaviors based on the attributes and methods defined in the class.\n",

    "          * Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world and exposing only the necessary information through a well-defined interface. It helps to protect the object's internal state and behavior from unwanted access or modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "          * Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class, inheriting all the properties and methods of the parent class. This allows the child class to reuse the code of the parent class and also add its own unique features.\n",
    "\n",
    "          * Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or have multiple behaviors. It allows the same method or operator to be used with different types of objects, enabling more flexibility and reusability in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "          * Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing complex real-world objects by focusing only on the essential aspects and ignoring unnecessary details. It allows programmers to create simplified models of real-world systems and interact with them through well-defined interfaces, without worrying about the underlying implementation details."
