    "       \n",
    "       Python programming language was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991. Guido van Rossum was a Dutch programmer who worked at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands (CWI) at the time. He created Python as a hobby project to address some shortcomings of the ABC programming language, which he had previously been working with. Since its release, Python has grown to become one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages in the world."

    "       Python supports several programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural programming. This means that programmers can use a variety of styles and techniques to write Python code, depending on the specific requirements of their project.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Python is primarily an object-oriented language, which means that it is designed to work with objects and classes. However, it also supports procedural programming, which involves writing functions and procedures that operate on data. Additionally, Python has functional programming features, such as the ability to use lambda functions and higher-order functions.\n",

    "3.Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",

    "      Yes, Python is a case-sensitive programming language when it comes to identifiers. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered distinct and separate in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "      For example, the variable names \"myVariable\" and \"myvariable\" are treated as two different identifiers in Python. If you try to use a variable or function name with incorrect capitalization, Python will not recognize it as the same identifier and may generate an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "      It's important to be consistent with your use of capitalization in Python code to avoid confusion and errors. It's common practice to use lowercase letters for variable and function names, while using uppercase letters for class names."

    "\n",
    "       The correct extension for a Python file is \".py\". When you save a Python program in a text file, you should give it a name that ends with the \".py\" extension. This tells your operating system that the file contains Python code.\n",

    "\n",
    "        When you run a Python program, the interpreter reads the source code line by line and executes it immediately. This allows for a faster development cycle since you can make changes to your code and see the results immediately without needing to recompile it.\n",
